this is my code in yaml:

  - name: Install Playwright Browsers
      run: npx playwright install --with-deps
      working-directory: ./tests
 
   

       #run playwright tests
    - name: Run Playwright Tests
      id: run_tests
      run: |
       # Ensure pipefail is set so the exit status of the first command in a pipeline is used.
       set -o pipefail
       EXIT_CODE=0
       # Run the tests. If npx playwright test exist nonzero, capture its exit code.
       DISPLAY=:99 npx playwright test --project="Microsoft Edge" --workers=1 --headed --grep '@QuoteSummary' 2>&1 | tee test_output.txt || EXIT_CODE=$?
       echo "Test exit code: $EXIT_CODE"
       # Set the exit code as a workflow output
       echo "exit-code=$EXIT_CODE" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
       # Exit with the captured code (this step is marked continue-on-error so subsequent steps run)
       exit $EXIT_CODE
      working-directory: ./tests
      continue-on-error: true

* but receiving below error in yaml file:



Run # Ensure pipefail is set so the exit status of the first command in a pipeline is used.
