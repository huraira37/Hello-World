Thanks for laying it out that way Huraira. I'm ireally nterested in having some sort of dashboard / more insight into your testing framework. Code coverage #'s could be a part of that, but I'm curious from your standpoint what you think would be helpful for me to see  
 
I don't want to send you down a POC path if you don't think it will be helpful / useful
